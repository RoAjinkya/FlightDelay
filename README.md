# FlightDelay
This is spark project that predicts if a US flight will be delayed. It implements a Spark neural net to create these predictions. The neural net was trained on all flight data from 2008 that can be found [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html). To increase the accuracy of the data we looked up the weather at the origin and destination airports. We also included holiday information that would aid in predicting the flight delays. 
## Web Front End (Java)
This project uses a simple dynamic web project (from eclipse) and an apache server to produce a web page where the user can choose the origin and destination and weather of the flight. 
## Neural net backend (Scala on Spark) 
The backend of this project implements a Spark neural net. Two models (cancellation and delay) were both trained with around 4 million records. Both models added weather information and holiday information to try to make the model more precise. The cancellation model is about 98% correct while the delay model was about 67% correct. 
## Gathering extra data (Scala)
To gather the weather from NOAA.gov a Scala script was written. Similarly, adding holiday information was done with a Scala script.
## Cleaning data (Python)
Python scripts were used to convert csv formatted data to svm formatted data. The script also removes unnecessary columns and changes origin and destination to oneâ€™s hot encoding.
